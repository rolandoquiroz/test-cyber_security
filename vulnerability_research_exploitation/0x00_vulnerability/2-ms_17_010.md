# MS17-010 Vulnerability Research

MS17-010 vulnerability by  National Vulnerability Database (NVD).
## CVE ID
The CVE ID for the MS17-010 vulnerability is CVE-2017-0144.
## Detailed Description
CVE-2017-0144 is a critical remote code execution vulnerability in Microsoft Server Message Block 1.0 (SMBv1). The vulnerability exists in the way that the Microsoft SMB server handles certain requests. An attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the ability to execute code on the target server.
The vulnerability specifically occurs because the SMBv1 server improperly handles specially crafted packets from remote attackers, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the target system with the privileges of the system account. This vulnerability affects multiple versions of Microsoft Windows.
This vulnerability became widely known as it was the primary exploit used in the WannaCry ransomware attack that spread globally in May 2017, affecting hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide.
## CVSS Score
The CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) base score for CVE-2017-0144 is 8.1 (High) under CVSS v3.0.
The CVSS vector string is: CVSS:3.0/AV/AC/PR/UI/S/C/I/A
This breaks down as:

Attack Vector (AV): Network - exploitable remotely
Attack Complexity (AC): High
Privileges Required (PR): None - no privileges needed
User Interaction (UI): None - no user interaction required
Scope (S): Unchanged
Confidentiality Impact (C): High
Integrity Impact (I): High
Availability Impact (A): High

## Potential Impacts
Exploiting this vulnerability could lead to several severe impacts:

- Remote Code Execution: Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the vulnerable system with SYSTEM privileges.
- Complete System Compromise: The attacker gains the highest level of privileges on the target system, allowing them to install programs, view, change, or delete data, or create new accounts with full user rights.
- Worm-like Spreading Capability: As demonstrated by WannaCry, exploits for this vulnerability can be designed to spread automatically across networks without user intervention.
- Ransomware Delivery: This vulnerability was famously used to deliver ransomware payloads that encrypted files and demanded payment.
- Data Theft: Attackers can access sensitive information stored on compromised systems.
- Persistent Access: The vulnerability can be used to establish persistent access to compromised systems.

## Mitigations and Patches
Microsoft has released several mitigations and patches for this vulnerability:

Security Bulletin MS17-010: Microsoft released security updates to address this vulnerability in March 2017, prior to the WannaCry attack. All affected users were advised to apply these patches immediately.
Specific Patches: Updates are available for Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8.1, Windows 10, Windows Server 2008, Windows Server 2012, and Windows Server 2016.
Workarounds:

Disable SMBv1 on systems where it's not required
Block SMB ports (TCP ports 139 and 445) at the network boundary
Implement network segmentation to limit the spread of worm-like threats


Extended Support: Microsoft took the unusual step of releasing patches for out-of-support systems such as Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 following the WannaCry outbreak.
SMBv1 Deprecation: Microsoft has recommended completely removing or disabling the SMBv1 protocol on all systems since it's an outdated protocol with known security issues.

For organizations that were unable to patch immediately, implementing firewall rules to block SMB traffic from the internet (TCP ports 139 and 445) was recommended as a temporary mitigation.
